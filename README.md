# PhoneBookClass
Simulate limitation in class attributes, and customisation of attribute behaviour with inheritance.   
Have the ability to generate a fully working class by simply specifying what class variables to have. Also, child classes only need to define what parameters to add (similar to __slots__ behaviour).    

An example of usage is already provided in the MainClasses.py file. Simply create your own classes that inherit from the base ones.
   
## Requirements
This project requires python 3.8 simply due to syntax. Changing this would be easy, and the lines that require python3.8 have a comment with that information.
